## What is MLeap?

[MLeap](https://github.com/combust/mleap) allows us to take Spark
pipelines to production. The MLeap runtime can recreate most of Sparkâ€™s
feature transformers and model predictions. This allows for the ML
Pipeline to be **deployed with no Spark dependencies**.

In practice, we can save the ML Pipeline Model (fitted model) as an
MLeap bundle (see Figure 1). MLeap serializes the pipeline steps and
model. The resulting Zip file can then be used in an external
environment that has MLeap. Once the MLeap bundle is loaded in the new
environment, new data can be passed to obtain predictions (see Figure
2).
